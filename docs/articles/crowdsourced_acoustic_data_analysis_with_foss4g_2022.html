</h2>
<p>NoiseCapture is an Android application developed by the Gustave Eiffel University and the CNRS as part of a participatory approach to environmental noise mapping. The application is open-source and all its data are free.</p>
<p>The study presented here is a first analysis of the first three years of data collection, through the prism of noise sources. The analysis only focused on the labels filled in by the users and not on the sound spectrum of the measurement, which will be studied later.</p>
<p>The aim was to determine whether known dynamics in environmental acoustics could be recovered using collaborative data.</p>
<p>This preparatory work having to be consolidated and extended thereafter, and with the will to include this study within the framework of the Open Science, an attention was brought on the reproducibility aspect of the analysis. This one was entirely realized with free software and literate programming techniques.</p>
<p>The context of the study, the tools and techniques used and the first results obtained will be presented as well as the benefits of using literate programming in this type of preparatory work.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#methodology"></a>
</h3>
<p>The beginining of this analysis was the release of a 3 years collection of environnemental acoustic samples. A first article presenting this dataset has been published in 2021 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picautSmartphoneBasedCrowdSourcedDatabase2021" role="doc-biblioref">Picaut et al. 2021</a>)</span>. It details the structure of the database and the data, the profile of the contributors and the contributions but does not analyze the content of the data. This is what this article proposes to begin.</p>
<p>As the NoiseCapture application is Open Source and the data collection infrastructure use Free and Open Source Softwares (FOSS), we decided to pursue this by using open source software for data analysis.</p>
<p>First, we will introduce the dataset then we will present the tools we used and why we choose them.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="data">Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data"></a>
</h4>
<p>The data used in this study correspond to contributions made between August 29, 2017 and August 28, 2020. During this period, nearly 70,000 unique contributors allowed the collection of more than 260,000 tracks for a total of about 60 million seconds of measurement. A trace is a collected recording, it contains the sound spectrum (1 second, third octave) recorded by the phone coupled with its GPS positioning (1 second). Each trace is timestamped too.</p>
<p>This information can be enriched by the contributor with labels. There are 18 labels and the user can select one or more of them for each of the traces made. The labels are detailed in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-picautSmartphoneBasedCrowdSourcedDatabase2021" role="doc-biblioref">Picaut et al. 2021</a>)</span>. The preliminary work presented here focuses on the analysis of the proportion of certain labels in the global sample at certain temporalities.</p>
<p>In addition to data from the collaborative collection, some additional data were used to limit the study area. We chose to limit the geographical scope of this preliminary study to metropolitan France because this area contains the largest number of recordings. The climate and sound dynamics are also well known by the authors and are well documented.</p>
<p>To facilitate the reproducibility of spatial filtering, it was decided to use open data sets from recognized sources: the Natural Earth database <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pattersonNaturalEarth2021" role="doc-biblioref">Patterson and Kelso 2021</a>)</span> and the Admin Express database from the National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-institutgeographiquenationalAdminExpress" role="doc-biblioref">Institut Géographique National 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The raw data has been stored and pre-filtered in a geospatial databases and has been analysed using a statistical analysis language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="tools">Tools<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tools"></a>
</h4>
<p>In order to be as open as possible and to work in the most collaborative way, we choose decided in a FOSS toolset: PostGreSQL/Postgis to store the data, the R language to analyse and produce knowlege from the data. We also used Git as it is a great tool to facilitate remote collaboration.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="postgis">PostGIS<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#postgis"></a>
</h5>
<p>The data are provided as a dump from a PostGreSQL/PostGIS database <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-paulramseyPostGIS2001" role="doc-biblioref">Ramsey and Blasby 2001</a>)</span>. Several scripts perform much of the attribute and spatial filtering. These filterings are saved in a materialized view. This view is the entry point for the R language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="r">R<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r"></a>
</h5>
<p>The R language <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rcoreteamRLanguageStatistical2021" role="doc-biblioref">R Core Team 2021</a>)</span> is a programming language for data processing and statistics with many libraries dedicated to geospatial data.</p>
<p>It is one of the recommended means for literate programming.</p>
<p>R allowed us to query the database to get data, refine it to our needs, then produce data analysis and graphs. Rmarkdown allows to mix code and text in markdown for the dynamic production of graphs, tables and documents. So it is a great tool to communicate inside our team and publish our results.</p>
<p>As our team is scaterred in several places in France, we also needed a tool to facilitate code sources communication, for this purpose, we used git.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="git">Git<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git"></a>
</h5>
<p>Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chacon2014pro" role="doc-biblioref">Chacon and Straub 2014</a>)</span>. It enables collaborative and decentralized work. The choice of Git was natural as different collaborators are present on several sites (Nantes, Lyon, Paris) and Git is already used within the UMRAE laboratory.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="implementation">Implementation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#implementation"></a>
</h4>
<p>The data are provided in the form of a PostGreSQL/PostGIS dump. A server has been set up accordingly to the documentation provided and the data loaded.<br>
A materialized view was created in order to provide a stable access to the data corresponding to the defined criteria.</p>
<p>These criteria are both attributive and spatial. We removed from the analysis the tracks taggued <em>test</em> or <em>indoor</em> as we wanted outdoor recording. We also filtered too short tracks (less than 5 seconds) and too long tracks (more than 15 minutes). We kept the tracks where the GPS median accuracy was higher than 20 meters. We also decided to keep tracks that are comprised in a rather small area (les than 625 square meters which correspond to a 25 by 25 meters square). We also pre-filtered the data using the NaturalEarth dataset to keep record within the France country. NaturalEarth is a great dataset and is well known worlwide however it does not distinguish France metropolitan area from overseas areas. This could have introduce complications with timezone handling and the seasons are not the same everywhere. So we had to separate overseas records from metropolitan ones. We did that operation using R.</p>
<p>A Rmarkdown document establishes the connection with the view and then performs the operations allowing to finalyze data preparation and analyze the data. It is a document mixing narrative, figures and code (in R but also several programming languages).</p>
<p>In this document, we refine the spatial filtering to France’s metropilotan area using an authoritative dataset <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-institutgeographiquenationalAdminExpress" role="doc-biblioref">Institut Géographique National 2021</a>)</span>. We also transform the track timestamp to local time and season using the R packages <code>lubridate</code> from the <code>tidyverse</code> metapackage <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019" role="doc-biblioref">Wickham et al. 2019</a>)</span> and <code>hydroTSM</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mauriciozambrano-bigiariniHydroTSMTimeSeries2020" role="doc-biblioref">Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We also used the suncalc package (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-thieurmelSuncalcComputeSun2019" role="doc-biblioref">Thieurmel and Elmarhraoui</a> (<a href="#ref-thieurmelSuncalcComputeSun2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>) to compute the sunrise time of the day of the track at its location.</p>

</h3>
<p>The main goal of this premliminary study was to verify the scientific value of crowdsourced acoustic data and if tags are sufficients to describe user environment.</p>
<p>The study concerns tracks bearing a tag, registered in metropolitan France. It focuses on the proportion of a certain tag in relation to all the tags for a given period (time of day, season, etc.). In the sample studied, it is possible to note a prevalence of the tags <em>road</em>, <em>chatting</em>, <em>animals</em> and <em>wind</em>. The tags <em>air_traffic</em> and <em>works</em> are also well represented.</p>
<p>A first axis of analysis concerns the time distribution of the tags. Animal noises (tag <em>animals</em>) are more frequent in the morning and especially one hour after sunrise.</p>
<p>This is a common dynamic for bird song <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-robbins1981effect" role="doc-biblioref">Robbins 1981</a>)</span>. We also observed peaks in human activity, especially commuting <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-MA2017135" role="doc-biblioref">Ma et al. 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The next temporal axis was the seasonality, especially those of animal noises, with a more intense activity in European spring and summer. This phenomenon could also be observed in the recordings. We also noticed that music was less present in autumn than in other seasons and that it is mostly present at late hours.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>The first results are encouraging because road dynamics related to commuting or animal activity can be observed. The main question was to determine if these known dynamics in environmental acoustics can be observed in a crowdsourced dataset. The first elements seem to answer positively to this question.</p>
<p>Some questions still need to be explored, notably those concerning the representativeness of samples that are sometimes weak for certain time periods.</p>
<p>The systematic use of open source software, the provision of documented code files and a document mixing narrative, figures and code have allowed the resumption and continuation of the analyses shown here. This work in progress will complete the final article.</p>
